# Introduction

This is a collection of simple Jupyter notebooks that I'm writing to learn about quantum computers. Some of these algorithms are not mine. However, I put in the first line a link for the original author.

# Notebooks

## Bell States

It shows how to create the bell states and a decoder.

## Teleportation

It shows how to create a quantum teleportation algorithm. I got this algorithm from the [Qiskit channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwovHK2NrE).
